				<h2 class="title1">What Are HEMIS Credits?</h2>
				<p class="discription1">
					You might have 
					<strong>heard</strong>
					about HEMIS credits, but why are they 
					<strong>important</strong>?
				</p>
				<h2 class="title2">HEMIS Credits:</h2>
				<p  class="description2"><strong>HEMIS</strong> (<strong>H</strong>igher <strong>E</strong>ducation <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>S</strong>ystem) credits:
					<br>
					<br>
					These are an important aspect of higher education as they help institutions to track and manage student progress and achievement. These credits are used to quantify the amount of learning that a student has completed in a particular course or program.
					<br>
					<br>
					HEMIS credits provide a common language for higher education institutions to communicate the value of courses and programs, and they also help to facilitate credit transfer between institutions. This is particularly important for students who may need to transfer from one institution to another or for those who wish to continue their studies at a later date.
					<br>
					<br>
					In addition to providing a measure of student achievement, HEMIS credits can also be used by institutions to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs and courses. By analyzing the credit data, institutions can identify areas where students may be struggling and make adjustments to improve the quality of their offerings.
					<br>
					<br>
					Overall, HEMIS credits are an important tool for managing and evaluating higher education programs and courses, and they help to ensure that students receive a consistent and high-quality education, regardless of which institution they attend.
					<br>
					<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				But don't fear, <strong>the HEMIS calculator is here!</strong></p>
			<h2 class="title2"> Calculating HEMIS Credits</h2>
			<p  class="description2">
				Let's say for example: A certain program has a <strong>total</strong> of 150 credits for the third year of study: 
				<br>
				150 module credits for that program = 1 HEMIS credit
				<br>
				<br>
				Let's say for example: A <strong>different</strong> program has a <strong>total</strong> of 147 credits for the third year of study:
				<br>
				147 module credits for the <strong>different</strong> program = 1 HEMIS credit 				
				<br>
				<br>
				The module 'Control Systems 314', which is included in first <strong>and</strong> second example, comprises: 
				15 module credits
				<br>
				<br>
				If you pass Control Systems 314 in the first example (with a total of 150 module credits for that year), you will therefore have gained:
				15 ÷ 150 = 0,1 HEMIS credits
				<br>
				<br>
				If you pass the same module in the second example, you will have gained: 
				15 ÷ 147 = 0,102 HEMIS credit

			<h2 class="title2"> Requirements For Renewal After Years Of Study In a BEng (4yr)</h2>
			<p  class="description2">
				<i><strong>- Requirements for renewal after one year of study in a BEng (4yr)</strong></i>
				<br>
				<br>
				You will normally only be permitted to continue your BEng studies after your first year of study if in that year:<br><br>
					• you acquired at least 0,6 HEMIS credits in prescribed modules of the first year of the BEng programme you are
					following; and<br>
					• at least 0,2 of the above 0,6 HEMIS credit were from the following modules:<br><br>
					o Applied Mathematics B 124<br>
					o Applied Mathematics B 154<br>
					o Engineering Mathematics 115<br>
					o Engineering Mathematics 145<br>
					<br><br>
					<br><br>
				<i><strong>- Requirements for renewal after two or more years of study in a BEng (4yr)</strong></i>
				<br>
				<br>
				As a BEng (4yr) student, you must have acquired the following HEMIS credits, after the number of years of study mentioned
				below, to be permitted to continue your studies:<br>
				• After 2 years at least 1,3 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 3 years at least 2,0 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 4 years at least 2,7 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 5 years at least 3,4 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 6 years at least 4,1 HEMIS credits<br><br>
				Further conditions<br><br>
				In addition to the HEMIS credits you must meet the following conditions to be able to renew your registration:<br>
				• After 2 years of full-time study, you must normally have passed all the prescribed modules for the first year of the
				BEng (4yr).<br>
				• After 4 years of full-time study, you must normally have passed all the prescribed modules of the first and second
				years of the BEng (4yr).<br>
				• After 6 years of full-time study, you must have completed the programme successfully and will normally not be
				permitted to continue if you haven't completed it.<br>
				• Irrespective of any other stipulations, you will normally only be permitted to study further if you have acquired at
				least 0,5 HEMIS credits in the year preceding the one in which you want to continue studying.<br><br>
				For example: If you passed all your modules in your first and second year, but in your third year you only managed
				to acquire 0,2 HEMIS credits, you will have 2,2 HEMIS credits. This means that you satisfy the requirement to have
				2,0 HEMIS credits after three years of study, but you do not satisfy this requirement of having 0,5 HEMIS credits in
				the preceding year.
				<br><br>
				<br><br>
				<i><strong>- Requirements for renewal after one year of study in a BEng (EDP)</strong></i>
				<br>
				<br>
				You must have passed all the modules of the first year to be admitted to the second year of the BEng (EDP) programme.
				The Faculty determines the performance level it requires for the first year and communicates it to students at the beginning of
				the academic year. You must pass all the modules of the first year on this level.

				As a BEng (EDP) student, you must have acquired the following HEMIS credits, after the number of years of study mentioned
				below, to be permitted to continue your studies:<br>
				Please note: The first year of a BEng (EDP) = 1 HEMIS credit<br>
				• After 2 years at least 1,6 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 3 years at least 2,3 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 4 years at least 3,0 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 5 years at least 3,7 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 6 years at least 4,4 HEMIS credits<br>
				• After 7 years at least 5,1 HEMIS credits<br><br>
				Further conditions<br>
				In addition to the HEMIS credits, you must meet the following conditions to be able to renew your registration:
				• After 3 years of full-time study, you must normally have passed all the prescribed modules for the first two years of
				study of the BEng (EDP).<br>
				• After 5 years of full-time study, you must normally have passed all the prescribed modules of the first three years of
				study of the BEng (EDP).<br>
				• After 7 years of full-time study, you must have completed the programme successfully and will normally not be
				permitted to continue if you have not completed it.<br>
				• Irrespective of any other stipulations, you will normally only be permitted to study further if you have acquired at
				least 0,5 HEMIS credits in the year preceding the one in which you want to continue studying.
				For example: If you passed all your modules in your first and second year, but in your third year you only managed
				to acquire 0,3 HEMIS credits, you will have 2,3 HEMIS credits. This means that you satisfy the requirement to have
				2,3 HEMIS credits after three years of study, but you do not satisfy this requirement of having 0,5 HEMIS credits in

			<h2 class="title2"> Applying For Readmission If You Did Not Meet The Requirements For Renewal</h2>
			<p  class="description2">
				If you do not meet the conditions to continue your studies at this University in your chosen BEng programme, you may apply
				for readmission to the particular programme. You must:<br>
				• apply in writing to the Registrar before the date given in Part 1 of the University Calendar, in the section
				“Readmission After Unsuccessful Studies”.<br>
				• include in your application a full statement of reasons why you should be readmitted, with supporting documentation
				where applicable.<br><br>
				The Readmission Committee of the University will consider your application and make a recommendation to the Executive
				Committee of Senate.<br>
				It may happen that your studies are interrupted before you can successfully apply for readmission. In that case, read the following:<br><br>
				You must normally register in a BEng programme for each consecutive year, from when you start in a BEng programme until
				you have completed it. If your registration is interrupted for one or more years, you will have to apply anew for admission and
				be selected before you may continue your BEng studies.<br>
				If your studies were interrupted for a period of three years or longer, the credits you accumulated previously will not
				automatically be transferred, but you may apply to have the modules you passed during your prior studies recognised. <br>

			<p class="discription1">Following modules for more than one year of study</p>
			<h2 class="title2"> Rules For Following Modules From More Than One Year Of Study</h2>
			<p  class="description2">
				You may register in a single semester for modules from more than one year of a particular programme. The following rules
				apply to BEng (4yr) as well as BEng (EDP) students who want to do that:<br>
				• To receive a final mark for a module, you must be registered for that module.<br>
				• You must meet the requirements regarding normal, co- and pass prerequisites.<br>
				• There must be no timetable clashes for classes, tests, assessments or examinations. The University publishes these
				timetables centrally and it is entirely your responsibility to make sure that there are no clashes.
				<strong>*Please note the exceptions discussed below.</strong><br>
				• You may register for at most 100% of the normal academic load per semester.
				For example: The total number of credits for a semester of the BEng (4yr) is typically 76 or fewer. Therefore, if you
				are registering for modules from the second and third year in a semester, your total combined load must be fewer
				than or equal to 76 credits.<br>
				<strong>*Please note the exceptions discussed below.</strong><br>
				• In a single semester, you may not simultaneously register for modules from more than two consecutive years of a
				degree programme.<br>
				For example: You may not register for a third-year module and a first-year module in the same semester, but you
				may register for a first-year module in the first semester and for a third-year module in the second semester, or vice
				versa.<br>
				• In any given semester, you may only register for modules from more than one year if you:<br><br>
				o have already passed all the modules for the corresponding semester of the more junior years, or<br>
				o if you are also registering for the modules from all the corresponding semesters of the more junior years, which
				you have not yet passed.<br><br>
				For example: You may follow a first-semester module from the third year if you:<br>
				 have already passed all the first-semester modules of the first two years, or<br>
				 if you have passed all the first-semester modules from the first year, as well as some of the modules from
				the second year, and you are also registering for the remaining first-semester modules from the second year.<br><br>
				The following exceptions apply to the rules above:<br>
				• You may not register for modules with clashing assessment timetables (that is, test, assessment or examination
				timetables), but you may register for two modules with clashing contact sessions (lectures, tutorials or practicals) if
				the clashes have been resolved. A clash has been resolved when lecturers from one or both of the clashing modules
				have granted you written exemption from clashing sessions.<br>
				• If you meet the requirements to register for the complete normal semester of a particular year of study, but in that
				semester you still have to pass one module from an earlier year, the chairperson of the programme's home department
				may permit you to register for the complete semester and the additional module. The following apply here:<br><br>
				o You will be permitted on merit to register for the additional module and must therefore have performed
				satisfactorily in other respects.<br>
				o The chairperson of the relevant department will make a decision in consultation with the Dean of the Faculty.
				Also note the stipulations about repeating a module in the section “Provisions Relating to Examination and Promotion” in Part
				1 of the University Calendar.<br>

				• Modules for which only satisfactory attendance is required: You can improve your final marks until the end of
